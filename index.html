  I"m starting to just get stuff in order. 
  I plan on sending you a web page that will be functional, hopefully with the calculations requested in the challenge.
<div class="companies">

<div class="input">
<input id="number" onClick={handleClick}/>
<p>Please enter a number indicating how much "stuff" you have to sell to the companies above.
  Please use numbers less than 55, and I haven't tested that high, but it should work, might miss some 5 number combinations
  because I stopped with 4 iterators.
